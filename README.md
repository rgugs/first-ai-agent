# Build an AI Agent in Python

This repository is my project for the Boot.dev "Build an AI Agent in Python" Course [here](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-ai-agent-python). The course uses Gemeni currently, however changes to Google's free tier limits have made it more difficult to complete the course without paying. Most students have mentioned it still costs very little if they bump up into the paid tiers, so that is still not a huge impedement to completing the course, however I decided to adjust the course to use a local LLM running on my computer.

I will be using LM Studio to try different models.
